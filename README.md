## ðŸ”§ Using the API

After setting up the project, you can interact with the Trading Toolbox using its API. Here's a guide to get you started:

### Accessing the API

1. **API Client (e.g., Postman)**:
   - Base URL: `http://localhost:1234/api`
   - Use POST, GET, PUT, PATCH, DELETE methods as required by each endpoint
   - Set `Content-Type: application/json` header for requests with a body
   - For authenticated endpoints, include the JWT token in the `Authorization` header:
     `Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN`

2. **Swagger UI**:
   - Access the interactive API documentation at `http://localhost:1234/api/docs`
   - Click on an endpoint to expand its details
   - Use the "Try it out" button to send requests directly from the browser
   - For authenticated endpoints, use the "Authorize" button to enter your JWT token

### Basic Workflow

1. Create a user account:
   - Endpoint: POST `/users/register`
   - Provide email and password

2. Log in to get an authentication token:
   - Endpoint: POST `/users/login`
   - Use the received JWT token for subsequent requests

3. Configure a trading account:
   - Endpoint: POST `/accounts`
   - Link your Bybit account by providing API key and secret

4. Choose your next steps:

   Option A: Use exchange features
   - Examples of available endpoints:
     - Fetch markets: GET `/markets/accounts/{accountId}`
     - Create an order: POST `/orders/accounts/{accountId}/orders`
     - Fetch positions: GET `/positions/accounts/{accountId}/positions`

   Option B: Set up trading strategies
   - Create a strategy: POST `/strategies`
   - Fetch strategies: GET `/strategies`
   - Update a strategy: PATCH `/strategies/{id}`

Refer to the Swagger UI documentation for detailed information on request/response formats for each endpoint.
